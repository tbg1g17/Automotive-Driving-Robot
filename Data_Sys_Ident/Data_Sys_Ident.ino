 * This code is to collect data from inputs and outputs of our robot and store the data in a csv file.
 * 
 * The code is to be used with the open-loop code created by Tom and the code for creating random PWM signal
 * where open-loop operation of the entire robot is held so that inputs and outputs to the motor are 
 * recorded and used with MATLAB's system-identification toolbox, hence finding the (approx.) TF of our 
 * entire system, relating the input voltage to the pedal's position (i.e., system output), or relating motor 
 * position to pedal position.
